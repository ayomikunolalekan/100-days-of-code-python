## Project Overview

This project applied the concepts I learned both in day 1 and day 2. In this project, I made use of  the input function to collect information from the user, variables to store the information collected and print statements to display the value of the variables.

The project aims to get to know the user by asking them a few questions and applying the concepts of variables, input statements and print statements to collect, store and display this information to the console.
