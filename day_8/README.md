## Project Overview  
This project is an Affirmation generator that sends affirmations to just two individuals to brighten up their day.  
It was built as the project for my eight day of 100 days of code and it made use of the concepts of if, elif and else statements, nested if statements, concatenation, variables and printing out the contents of the variables created.
