## Project Overview  
This project is a two player rock paper scissors game.  
It makes use of a while True loop and which keeps the game going until either player has won three rounds. The **exit()** function then ends the program when a player has been declared the winner. I was meant to make use of a continue statement while creating the project but was able to complete the project without it.
