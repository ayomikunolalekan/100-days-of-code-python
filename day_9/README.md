## Project Overview  
This project is a generation generator.  
Users input the year they were born and a message is printed out informing them which generation they belong to alongside a tacky or dad joke message.  
Concepts used while building the program are input and print statements, variables, int to cast strings to numbers and if, elif and else statements.
