## Project Overview  
This project is an animal sounds generator that when given an animal name, it gives the sounds they make.  
The main aim of this project is to harness the power of a while loop by repeatedly asking if the user wants to quit the program and if until they give a specific answer which is **yes**, the program will keep running.
