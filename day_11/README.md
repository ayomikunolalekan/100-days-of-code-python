## Project Overview  
In this project, I made use of my mathematical skills to develop a program that calculates the number of seconds in a year.  
The program asks the user if it is a leap year, if it is a leap year, the program performs the calculation with the appropriate values and if it isn't the program does the same thing before finally printing out the number of seconds in that year.
