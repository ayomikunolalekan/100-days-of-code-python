## Project Overview  
This project is my task for day 13 of 100 days of code.  
The project is a gradebook or a grade generator that asks the user the maximum score they can get in a test or exam, their score. The program then uses this detail to calculate the user's percentage grade and give them their grade based on a specific grading rubric.
